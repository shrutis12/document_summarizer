US President Donald Trump is expected to sign a new executive order aimed at strangulating work-visa programmes , including the H1B and L1 visas used by Indian IT professionals , as part of a larger immigration reform effort , a top White House official has said .
The executive order drafted by the Trump Administration not only strangulates H - 1B and L1 visas , but also increases inspection and ends employment authorisation cards to spouses on such work visas , which was recently introduced by the previous Obama Administration .
The draft of the order was leaked and published by some news websites yesterday
" I think with respect to H1Bs and other visa is part of a larger immigration reform effort that the President will continue to talk about through executive order and through working with Congress , " White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at his daily news conference .

TO REVERSE OBAMA'S EXTENSION As per the leaked draft order , Trump would reverse Obama's extension of the duration of the optional practical training work visas , which allowed foreign students to stay in the US a bit longer after completion of their studies .
